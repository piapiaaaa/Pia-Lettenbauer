            <div class="column col-lg-6">
              <p>As part of the CareerFoundry UX Design course, I chose to create a specialist advisory app: Expat Experts, a responsive web app that follows the mobile-first approach.</p>
              <p>The process of moving to another country can be quite difficult, because the questions can be very complex and the cases unique for each individual, which can make it very time consuming and sometimes impossible to find helpful
                answers.</p>
              <p>So Expat Experts was born, a responsive web app that helps with the process of moving to a new country, settling in and living in a foreign country. Users can book appointments with experts in various fields, such as immigration,
                career, relocation, taxes, etc. These expert advices are priced affordably and in different languages. Besides that, users can ask questions and share experiences with other users in the forum, as well as finding useful guides with
                great advice
                for different countries all over the world.</p>

        <h3>Informational Architecture</h3>
        <p>In the next step I developed a first attempt of the sitemap, based on all insights collected from my research. However, to validate the sitemap, I conducted a card sorting exercise with 9 participants. The results showed me that the
          participants had a general understanding of the pages and only minimal changes were made.</p>

        <h3>Low, Mid & High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
        <p>I developed a Minimum Viable Product with paper prototyping, which meant I could iterate quickly and test the UX of a product without having spent too much time on development costs. This journey between lo-fidelity to hi-fidelity gave
          me time to identify pain points along the user journey before moving to the next stage.</p>

        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>Next, I started with the first round of usability testing. The goal was to evaluate the learnability of the application’s functionality among the first time users on the mobile version. As well as to observe and measure how the users
          interact with the sign up and onboarding, general navigation through the app and how they will interact with the main features:</p>
        <p>a) Book a call with an expert<br>
          b) Post a new thread in the forum<br>
          d) Find a specific guide</p>
        <p>I conducted two moderated in-person and four moderated remote usabilty tests in total. All sessions were recorded and lasted between 30-40 min. <br>
          In order, to analyze all the finding I gathered from users during the usability tests, I first created an Affinity Map. To classify the found usability problems and to give recommendations for future iterations I then sorted them with
          the help of the Rainbow Spreadsheet.</p>

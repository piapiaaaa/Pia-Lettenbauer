            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As part of the CareerFoundry UX Design course, I chose to create a spacialist advisory app: Expat Experts, a responsive web app that follows the mobile-first approach.</p>
            <p>The process of moving to another country can be quite difficult, because the questions can be very complex and the cases unique for each individual, which can make it very time consuming and sometimes impossible to find helpful
              answers.</p>
            <p>So Expat Experts was born, a responsive web app that helps with the process of moving to a new country, settling in and living in a foreign country. Users can book appointments with experts in various fields, such as immigration,
              career,
              relocation, taxes, etc. These expert advices are priced affordably and in different languages. Besides that, users can ask questions and share experiences with other users in the forum, as well as finding useful guides with great advice
              for
              different countries all over the world.</p>

            <h4>Role</h4>
            <p>UX/UI Designer</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Period</h4>
            <p>June 2020 - Jan 2021</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Tools</h4>
            <p>Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop,
              Usability Hub, Google Forms</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Design Process</h4>
          <p>The methodology used for the development of the application was the Double Diamond Strategy. It focuses on breaking up the design process into four stages: Discover, Define, Develop & Deliver.</p>

        <div>
          <h2>Discover</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
          <p>In order for me to recognize and understand competitors and the market, I conducted a competitor analysis. I couldn’t find a product that was specifically providing expert advice for expats, however I did find two that offer general
            expert advice “Sterkla” and “Oncall”. During my analysis, I gained valuable insights regarding user needs, feelings and frustrations, which helped me to define better what was useful to design.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>User Persona</h4>
          <p>Based on my research and data findings I developed three personas, to better understand and empathize with the users needs, motivations and frustrations.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Informational Architecture</h4>
          <p>In the next step I developed a first attempt of the sitemap, based on all insights collected from my research. However, to validate the sitemap, I conducted a card sorting exercise with 9 participants. The results showed me that the
            participants had a general understanding of the pages and only minimal changes were made.</p>

        <div>
          <h4>Low, Mid & High-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
          <p>I developed a Minimum Viable Product with paper prototyping, which meant I could iterate quickly and test the UX of a product without having spent too much time on development costs. This journey between lo-fidelity to hi-fidelity gave
            me time to identify pain points along the user journey before moving to the next stage.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
          <p>Next, I started with the first round of usability testing. The goal was to evaluate the learnability of the application’s functionality among the first time users on the mobile version. As well as to observe and measure how the users
            interact with the sign up and onboarding, general navigation through the app and how they will interact with the main features:
            a) Book a call with an expert<br>
            b) Post a new thread in the forum<br>
            d) Find a specific guide<br>
            I conducted two moderated in-person and four moderated remote usabilty tests in total. All sessions were recorded and lasted between 30-40 min. <br>
            In order, to analyze all the finding I gathered from users during the usability tests, I first created an Affinity Map. To classify the found usability problems and to give recommendations for future iterations I then sorted them with
            the help of the Rainbow Spreadsheet.</p>

          <h4>Style Guide</h4>
          <p>Now it was time to put together the style guide, to be used as reference for all devices.</p>
